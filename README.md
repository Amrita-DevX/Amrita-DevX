👋 Hi, I’m Amrita Das

💼 I'm currently working as a Senior Systems Engineer at Infosys India on a healthcare insurance project, where I work extensively with SQL, PL/SQL, and claims data from FACETS. My role involves analyzing healthcare data, generating insights, and supporting business decisions through reports and backend analysis.

📊 I’m also transitioning into the field of Data Analytics. I actively use tools like Power BI and Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) in my current project tasks for data exploration, cleaning, and creating visual reports — alongside building personal portfolio projects to strengthen my analytics expertise.

🛠️ Tools & Skills: Python | SQL | Power BI | Pandas | NumPy | Excel | Scikit Learn

📈 I actively work on Kaggle, exploring various datasets, performing EDA, and sharing insights. Check out my work on Kaggle here 👉 [Kaggle Profile](https://www.kaggle.com/amritadas26)
